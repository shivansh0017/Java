"""
Scenario 1: Testing toString method when all class parameters have their initial values
Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithInitialValues
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the toString method when all class parameters have their initial values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize jobName=null, startTime=0, processingTime=null, lateness=0, and deadline=null.
  Act: Invoke the toString method. 
  Assert: Check if the output of the toString method is as expected, which should be "null, startTime: 0, endTime: 0, lateness: 0".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method works as expected when all class parameters have their initial values. This is important to check as it is a common scenario that can occur in the application.

Scenario 2: Testing toString method when jobName, startTime, processingTime, and lateness have valid values
Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithValidValues
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the toString method when jobName, startTime, processingTime, and lateness have valid values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize jobName="Job1", startTime=10, processingTime=20, and lateness=5.
  Act: Invoke the toString method. 
  Assert: Check if the output of the toString method is as expected, which should be "Job1, startTime: 10, endTime: 30, lateness: 5".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method works as expected when jobName, startTime, processingTime, and lateness have valid values. This is important to check as it is a common scenario that can occur in the application.

Scenario 3: Testing toString method when processingTime is null
Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithNullProcessingTime
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the toString method when processingTime is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize jobName="Job1", startTime=10, processingTime=null, and lateness=5.
  Act: Invoke the toString method. 
  Assert: Check if the output of the toString method is as expected, which should be "Job1, startTime: 10, endTime: 10, lateness: 5".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly handles null processingTime. This is important to check as it can occur in the application if the processing time for a job is not set.

Scenario 4: Testing toString method when jobName is null
Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithNullJobName
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the toString method when jobName is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize jobName=null, startTime=10, processingTime=20, and lateness=5.
  Act: Invoke the toString method. 
  Assert: Check if the output of the toString method is as expected, which should be "null, startTime: 10, endTime: 30, lateness: 5".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the toString method correctly handles null jobName. This is important to check as it can occur in the application if the name for a job is not set.
