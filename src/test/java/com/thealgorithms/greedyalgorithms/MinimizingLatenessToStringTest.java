"""
Scenario 1: Test when jobName, startTime, processingTime and lateness are all set to their default values
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithDefaultValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString() method when jobName is null, startTime, processingTime and lateness are all zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set jobName to null, startTime, processingTime and lateness to zero.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned string is in the correct format and contains the default values.
  This test is significant as it confirms that the toString() method can handle and correctly format default values.
Scenario 2: Test when jobName, startTime, processingTime and lateness are all set to some specific values
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithSpecificValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString() method when jobName, startTime, processingTime and lateness are set to some specific values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set jobName to "Job1", startTime to 10, processingTime to 20 and lateness to 30.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned string is in the correct format and contains the specific values.
  This test is significant as it confirms that the toString() method can handle and correctly format specific values.
Scenario 3: Test when jobName contains special characters
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithSpecialCharInJobName
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString() method when jobName contains special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set jobName to "Job#1", startTime, processingTime and lateness to zero.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned string is in the correct format and contains the jobName with special characters.
  This test is significant as it confirms that the toString() method can handle and correctly format jobName with special characters.
Scenario 4: Test when startTime, processingTime and lateness are set to negative values
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithNegativeValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString() method when startTime, processingTime and lateness are set to negative values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set jobName to "Job1", startTime, processingTime and lateness to -10.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned string is in the correct format and contains the negative values.
  This test is significant as it confirms that the toString() method can handle and correctly format negative values.
Scenario 5: Test when processingTime is greater than startTime
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWhenProcessingTimeGreaterThanStartTime
  Description: This test is meant to check the toString() method when processingTime is greater than startTime.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set jobName to "Job1", startTime to 10, processingTime to 20 and lateness to zero.
  Act: Invoke the toString() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned string is in the correct format and contains the endTime which is the sum of startTime and processingTime.
  This test is significant as it confirms that the toString() method can correctly calculate and format the endTime even when processingTime is greater than startTime.
