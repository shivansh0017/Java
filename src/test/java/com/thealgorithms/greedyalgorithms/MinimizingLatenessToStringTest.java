"""
Scenario 1: Test when jobName, startTime, processingTime and lateness are all set to their default values

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithDefaultValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the output of the toString method when the jobName is null and the startTime, processingTime and lateness are all set to 0. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set jobName to null, startTime to 0, processingTime to 0 and lateness to 0.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected output which is "null, startTime: 0, endTime: 0, lateness: 0".
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the toString method correctly formats the string when all parameters are set to their default values. This is significant as it tests the method's ability to handle default or null values.

Scenario 2: Test when jobName, startTime, processingTime and lateness are set to valid values

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithValidValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the output of the toString method when the jobName, startTime, processingTime, and lateness are set to valid values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set jobName to "Job1", startTime to 1, processingTime to 2 and lateness to 3.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected output which is "Job1, startTime: 1, endTime: 3, lateness: 3".
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the toString method correctly formats the string when all parameters are set to valid values. This is significant as it tests the method's core functionality.

Scenario 3: Test when jobName contains special characters

Details:  
  TestName: testToStringWithSpecialCharactersInJobName
  Description: This test is meant to check the output of the toString method when the jobName contains special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set jobName to "Job#1", startTime to 1, processingTime to 2 and lateness to 3.
  Act: Invoke the toString method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected output which is "Job#1, startTime: 1, endTime: 3, lateness: 3".
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the toString method correctly handles special characters in the jobName. This is significant as it tests the method's ability to handle special characters.
