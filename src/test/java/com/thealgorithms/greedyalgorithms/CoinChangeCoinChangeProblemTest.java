ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=coinChangeProblem_9cb8b5505c
Scenario 1: Test with a zero amount
  Details:
    TestName: testWithZeroAmount
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when the amount is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as the amount is zero.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with zero as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the method correctly handles the edge case of zero amount. The expected result is an empty list because no coins are needed to make up zero amount.
Scenario 2: Test with a negative amount
  Details:
    TestName: testWithNegativeAmount
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when the amount is negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as the amount is negative.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a negative number as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the method correctly handles the edge case of a negative amount. The expected result is an empty list because no coins are needed to make up a negative amount.
Scenario 3: Test with a positive amount
  Details:
    TestName: testWithPositiveAmount
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when the amount is positive.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as the amount is positive.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a positive number as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned list is not empty and the sum of the values in the list equals the amount.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the method correctly solves the coin change problem for a positive amount. The expected result is a list of coins that sum up to the amount.
Scenario 4: Test with a large amount
  Details:
    TestName: testWithLargeAmount
    Description: This test is meant to check the performance and correctness of the method when the amount is large.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement required as the amount is large.
    Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a large number as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the returned list is not empty and the sum of the values in the list equals the amount.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the method can handle large amounts without performance issues and still return the correct result. The expected result is a list of coins that sum up to the amount.
