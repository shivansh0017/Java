Scenario 1: Normal case test - changing a large amount

Details: 
  TestName: testChangeLargeAmount
  Description: This test is meant to check the function's ability to break a large amount into smaller increments. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an amount variable to a large value, for example, 4650.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem() method with the defined amount, and save the return list.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the list contains expected coins order and can sum to the correct total.
Validation:
  The test verifies if the function can correctly and efficiently break down a large amount using the provided denominations. 
  The expected behavior is that the function should always use the largest possible denomination to reduce the remaining amount.

Scenario 2: Edge case test - changing a small amount

Details: 
  TestName: testChangeSmallAmount
  Description: This test aims to check the function's capability of handling small amounts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an amount variable to a small value, for example, 3.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem() method with the defined amount, and save the return list.
  Assert: Check if the return list contains the right coins can sum up to the correct total.
Validation:
  This test verifies if the function correctly deals with small amounts using the provided denominations, especially when the amount is less than the smallest denomination in the array.
  The expected behavior is that the function should correctly break down the amount into valid denominations.

Scenario 3: Testing zero amount

Details: 
  TestName: testChangeZeroAmount
  Description: This test is to verify the function's ability to handle a 0 amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount variable to 0.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem() method with the defined amount, and save the return list.
  Assert: Assert that the return list is empty.
Validation:
  This test is important as it tests if the function will handle edge cases like 0 amount correctly. 
  The expected result is an empty list returned as there are no coins necessary for an amount of zero.

Scenario 4: Negative amount test

Details: 
  TestName: testChangeNegativeAmount
  Description: This test aims to verify the function's behavior when it receives a negative amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount variable to a negative value, for example, -15.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem() method with the defined amount.
  Assert: A runtime error should be detected as a negative number for coins is not logical.
Validation:
  This test verifies if the function can successfully detect and respond to incorrect input values, in this case, negative numbers.
  The expected behavior is that the function should detect the negative number and either throw an error or return a message indicating invalid input.
