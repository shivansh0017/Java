Here are the test scenarios for the `coinChangeProblem` method:

**Scenario 1: Valid Amount with Single Coin Denomination**

Details:
  TestName: validAmountSingleCoin
  Description: Verifies that the method returns a list of coins with a single denomination for a valid amount.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an amount of 10.
  Act: Invoke `coinChangeProblem(10)`.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains a single coin of denomination 10.

Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method can handle a valid amount with a single coin denomination. The expected result is a list containing a single coin of denomination 10, as it is the largest coin that can be used to make up the amount.

**Scenario 2: Valid Amount with Multiple Coin Denominations**

Details:
  TestName: validAmountMultipleCoins
  Description: Verifies that the method returns a list of coins with multiple denominations for a valid amount.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an amount of 37.
  Act: Invoke `coinChangeProblem(37)`.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains coins of denominations 20, 10, and 5, and 2.

Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method can handle a valid amount with multiple coin denominations. The expected result is a list containing coins of denominations 20, 10, 5, and 2, as they are the optimal combination to make up the amount.

**Scenario 3: Zero Amount**

Details:
  TestName: zeroAmount
  Description: Verifies that the method returns an empty list for a zero amount.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an amount of 0.
  Act: Invoke `coinChangeProblem(0)`.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.

Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method handles a zero amount correctly. The expected result is an empty list, as no coins are needed to make up a zero amount.

**Scenario 4: Negative Amount**

Details:
  TestName: negativeAmount
  Description: Verifies that the method throws an exception for a negative amount.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an amount of -10.
  Act: Invoke `coinChangeProblem(-10)`.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.

Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method handles an invalid negative amount correctly. The expected result is an exception, as a negative amount is not a valid input.

**Scenario 5: Amount Greater than Maximum Coin Denomination**

Details:
  TestName: amountGreaterThanMaxCoin
  Description: Verifies that the method returns a list of coins for an amount greater than the maximum coin denomination.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an amount of 2500.
  Act: Invoke `coinChangeProblem(2500)`.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains coins of denominations 2000, 500, and so on.

Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method can handle an amount greater than the maximum coin denomination. The expected result is a list containing coins of denominations 2000, 500, and so on, as they are the optimal combination to make up the amount.

**Scenario 6: Amount Equal to Maximum Coin Denomination**

Details:
  TestName: amountEqualToMaxCoin
  Description: Verifies that the method returns a list of coins for an amount equal to the maximum coin denomination.

Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an amount of 2000.
  Act: Invoke `coinChangeProblem(2000)`.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains a single coin of denomination 2000.

Validation: 
  This test verifies that the method can handle an amount equal to the maximum coin denomination. The expected result is a list containing a single coin of denomination 2000, as it is the largest coin that can be used to make up the amount.
