"""
Scenario 1: Test with zero amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithZeroAmount
  Description: This test aims to verify the functionality when the amount is zero. As per the business logic, an empty list should be returned as there are no coins required to make the amount zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the amount to zero.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the arranged amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case when the amount is zero. The expected result is an empty list because no coins are required to make up the amount zero.
Scenario 2: Test with an amount that is exactly equal to a single coin denomination
Details:
  TestName: testWithSingleCoinAmount
  Description: This test aims to check the functionality when the amount is exactly equal to a single coin denomination. According to the business logic, a list containing that single coin denomination should be returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the amount to a single coin denomination.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the arranged amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains only that single coin denomination.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case when the amount is exactly equal to a single coin denomination. The expected result is a list containing only that denomination, as it is the minimum number of coins required to make up the amount.
Scenario 3: Test with an amount that requires multiple coin denominations
Details:
  TestName: testWithMultipleCoinAmount
  Description: This test aims to check the functionality when the amount requires multiple coin denominations. According to the business logic, a list containing the required coins in descending order of denomination should be returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the amount to a value that requires multiple coin denominations.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the arranged amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list contains the correct coin denominations in descending order.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case when the amount requires multiple coin denominations. The expected result is a list containing the required coins in descending order of denomination, as the method aims to minimize the number of coins used.
Scenario 4: Test with a negative amount
Details:
  TestName: testWithNegativeAmount
  Description: This test aims to check the functionality when the amount is negative. As per the business logic, an empty list should be returned as a negative amount cannot be made up with positive coin denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the amount to a negative value.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with the arranged amount.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case when the amount is negative. The expected result is an empty list because a negative amount cannot be made up with positive coin denominations.
