ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=coinChangeProblem_9cb8b5505c

Scenario 1: Test with valid amount 
Details:  
  TestName: testWithValidAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the coinChangeProblem method when a valid amount is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as the method does not depend on any external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a valid amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly computes the minimum number of coins required to make up the given amount. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method uses the largest denomination coins as much as possible before moving to smaller denominations.

Scenario 2: Test with zero amount
Details:  
  TestName: testWithZeroAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the coinChangeProblem method when the amount is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as the method does not depend on any external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with an amount of zero.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly returns an empty list when the amount is zero. This is because no coins are required to make up an amount of zero.

Scenario 3: Test with negative amount
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the coinChangeProblem method when a negative amount is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as the method does not depend on any external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a negative amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly returns an empty list when the amount is negative. This is because it is not possible to make up a negative amount with positive denomination coins.

Scenario 4: Test with amount not divisible by the smallest coin denomination
Details:  
  TestName: testWithNonDivisibleAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the coinChangeProblem method when the amount provided is not divisible by the smallest coin denomination.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement required as the method does not depend on any external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with an amount not divisible by the smallest coin denomination.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly computes the minimum number of coins required to make up the given amount. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method uses the largest denomination coins as much as possible before moving to smaller denominations.
