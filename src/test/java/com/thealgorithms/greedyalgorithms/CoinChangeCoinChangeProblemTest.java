ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=coinChangeProblem_9cb8b5505c
Scenario 1: Validate Correct Coin Change for a Given Amount
Details:
  TestName: testCoinChangeForGivenAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly calculates the coin change for a given amount. The test will pass a specific amount and validate the returned list of coins.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as the method does not require external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a specific amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned list of coins against the expected list.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly calculates the coin change for a given amount. The expected result is based on the known coin denominations and the greedy algorithm used by the method. This test is significant as it validates the core functionality of the method.
Scenario 2: Validate Handling of Zero Amount
Details:
  TestName: testZeroAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a zero amount. The test will pass zero as the amount and validate the returned list of coins.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as the method does not require external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with zero as the amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list of coins is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a zero amount by returning an empty list of coins. The expected result is based on the fact that there is no coin change for a zero amount. This test is significant as it validates the method's handling of edge cases.
Scenario 3: Validate Handling of Negative Amount
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeAmount.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly handles a negative amount. The test will pass a negative number as the amount and validate the returned list of coins.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is needed as the method does not require external dependencies.
  Act: Invoke the coinChangeProblem method with a negative number as the amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list of coins is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles a negative amount by returning an empty list of coins. The expected result is based on the fact that there is no coin change for a negative amount. This test is significant as it validates the method's handling of invalid input.
