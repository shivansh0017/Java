ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=coinChangeProblem_9cb8b5505c

Here are the test scenarios for the provided coinChangeProblem method:

Scenario 1: Test with a valid amount

Details:
  TestName: validAmountReturnsCorrectCoins
  Description: This test verifies that the coinChangeProblem method returns the correct list of coins for a valid amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a valid value, e.g., 2578.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the valid amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned list of coins with the expected list of coins.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly selects the optimal combination of coins to make up the given amount.
  This test ensures that the method works as expected for valid input and returns the correct change.

Scenario 2: Test with an amount of zero

Details:
  TestName: zeroAmountReturnsEmptyList
  Description: This test checks that the coinChangeProblem method returns an empty list when the amount is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to zero.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the zero amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method handles the case of zero amount correctly and returns an empty list.
  This test ensures that the method does not attempt to provide change for a zero amount.

Scenario 3: Test with a negative amount

Details:
  TestName: negativeAmountReturnsEmptyList
  Description: This test verifies that the coinChangeProblem method returns an empty list when the amount is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a negative value, e.g., -100.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the negative amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method handles negative amounts correctly and returns an empty list.
  This test ensures that the method does not attempt to provide change for a negative amount.

Scenario 4: Test with an amount that cannot be made up with the available coins

Details:
  TestName: amountNotPossibleWithCoinsReturnsEmptyList
  Description: This test checks that the coinChangeProblem method returns an empty list when the amount cannot be made up with the available coin denominations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a value that cannot be made up with the available coins, e.g., 7.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the impossible amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method handles the case where the amount cannot be made up with the available coins and returns an empty list.
  This test ensures that the method does not provide an incorrect combination of coins when the amount is not possible.

Scenario 5: Test with a large amount

Details:
  TestName: largeAmountReturnsCorrectCoins
  Description: This test verifies that the coinChangeProblem method returns the correct list of coins for a large amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the amount to a large value, e.g., 1000000.
  Act: Call the coinChangeProblem method with the large amount.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned list of coins with the expected list of coins.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly selects the optimal combination of coins to make up the large amount.
  This test ensures that the method works as expected for large input values and returns the correct change.

These test scenarios cover various cases, including valid amounts, edge cases like zero and negative amounts, impossible amounts, and large amounts. They ensure that the coinChangeProblem method behaves correctly in different scenarios and handles edge cases appropriately.
