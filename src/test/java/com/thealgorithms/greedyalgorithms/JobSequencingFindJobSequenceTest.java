Scenario 1: Valid Job Sequence With All Slots Filled
Details:
  TestName: testValidJobSequenceWithAllSlotsFilled
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly generates the job sequence when all slots are filled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with deadlines such that all slots can be filled.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created ArrayList and its size as parameters.
  Assert: Compare the returned job sequence with the expected job sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly generates the job sequence when all slots are filled. The expected result is based on the known job deadlines and their order of insertion. The test is significant as it verifies the basic functionality of the function.
Scenario 2: Valid Job Sequence With Some Slots Unfilled
Details:
  TestName: testValidJobSequenceWithSomeSlotsUnfilled
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly generates the job sequence when some slots are left unfilled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with deadlines such that some slots are left unfilled.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created ArrayList and its size as parameters.
  Assert: Compare the returned job sequence with the expected job sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly generates the job sequence when some slots are left unfilled. The expected result is based on the known job deadlines and their order of insertion. This test is significant as it checks the function's behavior when not all slots can be filled.
Scenario 3: Empty Job List
Details:
  TestName: testEmptyJobList
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an empty job list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of Job objects.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the empty ArrayList and 0 as parameters.
  Assert: Compare the returned job sequence with the expected job sequence (an empty string).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly handles an empty job list. The expected result is an empty string since there are no jobs to sequence. This test is significant as it checks the function's error handling capabilities.
Scenario 4: Job List With Larger Size Than Slots
Details:
  TestName: testJobListWithLargerSizeThanSlots
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a job list that has a larger size than the number of slots.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with more jobs than available slots.
  Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created ArrayList and a size smaller than the ArrayList's size as parameters.
  Assert: Compare the returned job sequence with the expected job sequence.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly generates the job sequence even when the job list is larger than the number of slots. The expected result is based on the known job deadlines and their order of insertion. This test is significant as it checks the function's behavior when there are more jobs than slots.
