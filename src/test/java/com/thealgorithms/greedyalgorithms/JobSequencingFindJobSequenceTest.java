"""
Scenario 1: Valid Job Sequence With All Slots Filled
Details:
  TestName: testValidJobSequenceWithAllSlotsFilled
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct job sequence is returned when all jobs are scheduled and all slots are filled.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with varying deadlines and sizes that will fill all slots.
    Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created ArrayList and its size as parameters.
    Assert: Utilize JUnit assertions to compare the returned job sequence against the expected sequence.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the job sequence returned matches the expected sequence. This is important as it verifies the function's ability to schedule jobs correctly when all slots can be filled.
Scenario 2: Valid Job Sequence With Some Slots Unfilled
Details:
  TestName: testValidJobSequenceWithSomeSlotsUnfilled
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct job sequence is returned when not all jobs can be scheduled and some slots remain unfilled.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Job objects with varying deadlines and sizes that will not fill all slots.
    Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the created ArrayList and its size as parameters.
    Assert: Utilize JUnit assertions to compare the returned job sequence against the expected sequence.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the job sequence returned matches the expected sequence. This is important as it verifies the function's ability to schedule jobs correctly when not all slots can be filled.
Scenario 3: Valid Job Sequence With No Jobs Scheduled
Details:
  TestName: testValidJobSequenceWithNoJobsScheduled
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct job sequence is returned when there are no jobs to be scheduled.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of Job objects.
    Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the empty ArrayList and size 0 as parameters.
    Assert: Utilize JUnit assertions to compare the returned job sequence against the expected sequence ("Job Sequence: ").
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the job sequence returned matches the expected sequence. This is important as it checks the function's ability to handle the edge case of no jobs to be scheduled.
Scenario 4: Error Handling for Null Job List
Details:
  TestName: testErrorHandlingForNullJobList
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle a null job list without throwing an error.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the job list parameter to null.
    Act: Invoke the findJobSequence method with the null job list and size 0 as parameters.
    Assert: Utilize JUnit assertions to confirm that an appropriate error is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that an appropriate error is thrown when a null job list is passed. This is significant as it checks the function's error handling ability.
