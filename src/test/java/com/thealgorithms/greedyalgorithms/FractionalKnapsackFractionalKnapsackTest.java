"""
  Scenario 1: Testing the Scenarios where the Knapsack has enough capacity
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testKnapsackWithEnoughCapacity
    Description: This test would check if the function is properly calculating the highest value of items that can be fitted in the knapsack when the capacity is not a limiting factor. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create arrays of weights and corresponding values of items and also define a high knapsack capacity.
    Act: Invoke fractionalKnapsack() with the weight, value, and capacity defined above.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual knapsack's total value with the sum of all items' values.
  Validation: 
    This test is to verify that the function effectively utilises the knapsack's capacity when there are enough resources. The expected result would be the sum of all items' values because the knapsack can handle all items.

  Scenario 2: Testing the Scenarios where the Knapsack has limited capacity
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testKnapsackWithLimitedCapacity
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function is properly calculating the highest value of items that can be fitted in the knapsack when the capacity can only handle some items. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create arrays of weights and corresponding values of items and also define a low knapsack capacity.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack() function with the weight, value, and capacity defined above.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual knapsack's total value with the maximum value that can be fitted in the given capacity.
  Validation: 
    This test is to verify that the function effectively utilises the knapsack's capacity when the capacity is a limiting factor. The expected result would be a value higher than the total value of the items that can be fitted in the given capacity, since the function should be able to fit fractions of items.

  Scenario 3: Testing the Scenarios when Knapsack's capacity is Zero
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testKnapsackWithZeroCapacity
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function is returning 0 as the total value when the knapsack capacity is 0, irrespective of the number of items available.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create arrays of weights and corresponding values of items and also define knapsack capacity as 0.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack() function with the weight, value, and capacity defined above.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual knapsack's total value with 0.
  Validation:
    This test is to verify the function handles a scenario when the knapsack has no capacity. The expected result is 0, since nothing can be fitted in the knapsack.

  Scenario 4: Testing the Scenarios when No Items are Available
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testKnapsackWithNoItems
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function is returning 0 as the total value when no items are available to be added to the knapsack.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create empty arrays for weights and values and set some capacity for the knapsack.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack() function with the weight, value, and capacity defined above.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual knapsack's total value with 0.
  Validation:
    This test is to verify the function handles a scenario when there are no items to add. The expected result is 0, since there's nothing to add to the knapsack.
