ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=fractionalKnapsack_1caf503527

Scenario 1: Test with a valid weight and value array with appropriate capacity
Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithValidInput
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly calculates the maximum value that can fit in the knapsack given the weights, values, and capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up weight, value arrays and capacity. 
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the weight, value arrays and capacity.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the function correctly calculates the maximum value. The expected result is based on manual calculations. This test is significant as it validates the core functionality of the fractional knapsack algorithm.

Scenario 2: Test with empty weight and value arrays
Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithEmptyArrays
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles empty weight and value arrays.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up empty weight, value arrays and a capacity. 
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the empty weight, value arrays and capacity.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the function returns 0 when the weight and value arrays are empty. This is because there are no items to add to the knapsack. This test is important for validating the function's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 3: Test with a zero capacity
Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithZeroCapacity
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles a knapsack with zero capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up weight, value arrays and a zero capacity. 
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the weight, value arrays and zero capacity.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the function returns 0 when the capacity is zero. This is because no items can fit in the knapsack. This test is important for validating the function's error handling capabilities.

Scenario 4: Test with weight and value arrays of different lengths
Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithMismatchedArrayLengths
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles weight and value arrays of different lengths.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up weight, value arrays of different lengths and a capacity. 
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the mismatched weight, value arrays and capacity.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the function throws an error when the weight and value arrays are of different lengths. This is because each weight must correspond to a value. This test is important for validating the function's error handling capabilities.

//The compilation error suggests that the version of Java being used does not support unnamed classes. 
//This error might be occurring due to the lambda function used in the assertThrows statement in the 
//testFractionalKnapsackWithMismatchedArrayLengths test. If the Java version being used does not support 
//lambda functions, then the test case might need to be rewritten using an anonymous inner class.
