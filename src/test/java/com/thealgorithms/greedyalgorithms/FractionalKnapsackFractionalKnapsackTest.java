Scenario 1: Test with valid inputs for fractional knapsack problem

Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithValidInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly calculates the maximum value that can fit in the knapsack when valid weights, values, and capacity are passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up weight array, value array, and knapsack capacity.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the appropriate parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
  Validation: 
    Verify that the returned value is the maximum possible value that can fit in the knapsack. This test is significant as it ensures that the function correctly implements the fractional knapsack algorithm.

Scenario 2: Test with zero knapsack capacity

Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithZeroCapacity
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles the scenario where the knapsack capacity is zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up weight array, value array, and knapsack capacity as zero.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the appropriate parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
  Validation: 
    Verify that the returned value is zero, as no item can fit in the knapsack. This test is significant as it ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test with negative knapsack capacity

Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithNegativeCapacity
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles the scenario where the knapsack capacity is negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up weight array, value array, and knapsack capacity as negative.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the appropriate parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
  Validation: 
    Verify that the function throws an appropriate exception, as knapsack capacity cannot be negative. This test is significant as it ensures that the function correctly handles invalid inputs.

Scenario 4: Test with empty weight and value arrays

Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithEmptyArrays
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles the scenario where the weight and value arrays are empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up empty weight and value arrays, and a valid knapsack capacity.
    Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack method with the appropriate parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
  Validation: 
    Verify that the returned value is zero, as no items are available to put in the knapsack. This test is significant as it ensures that the function correctly handles edge cases.
