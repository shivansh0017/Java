Scenario 1: Test with a valid weight and value array with equal lengths

Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithValidArrays
  Description: This test is meant to check if the fractionalKnapsack function works as expected when provided with valid weight and value arrays of equal length. The test will also verify if the function correctly calculates the maximum value that can be obtained from the items within the given capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create arrays for weight and value with equal lengths and a capacity integer. 
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack function with the weight array, value array, and capacity.
  Assert: Compare the actual result against the expected maximum value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly calculates the maximum value. The expected result is based on the value-to-weight ratio of the items and the capacity of the knapsack. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test with weight and value arrays of different lengths

Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithUnequalArrayLengths
  Description: This test is meant to check if the fractionalKnapsack function throws an exception when provided with weight and value arrays of different lengths. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create arrays for weight and value with different lengths and a capacity integer.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack function with the weight array, value array, and capacity.
  Assert: Expect an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the function throws an exception when the weight and value arrays have different lengths. This test is significant as it checks the function's error handling.

Scenario 3: Test with a capacity that is less than the smallest weight in the weight array

Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithSmallCapacity
  Description: This test is meant to check if the fractionalKnapsack function returns 0 when the capacity is less than the smallest weight in the weight array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create arrays for weight and value, and a capacity integer that is less than the smallest weight.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack function with the weight array, value array, and capacity.
  Assert: Expect the result to be 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the function correctly returns 0 when the capacity is less than the smallest weight. This test is significant as it checks the function's handling of edge cases.

Scenario 4: Test with negative weights or values in the arrays

Details:  
  TestName: testFractionalKnapsackWithNegativeValues
  Description: This test is meant to check if the fractionalKnapsack function throws an exception when provided with negative weights or values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create arrays for weight and value with at least one negative number, and a capacity integer.
  Act: Invoke the fractionalKnapsack function with the weight array, value array, and capacity.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the function throws an exception when the weight or value arrays contain negative numbers. This test is significant as it checks the function's error handling.
