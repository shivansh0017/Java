"""
Scenario 1: Test with valid input where there are multiple compatible activities.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithValidInputAndMultipleCompatibleActivities
  Description: This test checks if the activitySelection function correctly returns the indices of the compatible activities sorted by end times when valid start times and end times are given as inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the start times and end times arrays with valid data where there are multiple compatible activities.
  Act: Invoke activitySelection with the start times and end times arrays.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list of indices matches the expected list of indices.
Validation: 
  This test validates the core functionality of the activitySelection function. The expected outcome is derived based on the logic that the function should select the activities that end earliest.

Scenario 2: Test with valid input where there are no compatible activities.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithValidInputAndNoCompatibleActivities
  Description: This test checks if the activitySelection function correctly returns only the first activity when no other activities are compatible with it. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the start times and end times arrays with valid data where no activities are compatible with each other.
  Act: Invoke activitySelection with the start times and end times arrays.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list of indices only contains the index of the first activity.
Validation: 
  This test validates that the function can handle the case where no activities are compatible with each other. The expected outcome is derived from the assumption that the function should select the first activity in such cases.

Scenario 3: Test with an empty input

Details:  
  TestName: testWithEmptyInput
  Description: This test checks if the activitySelection function correctly returns an empty list when both start times and end times arrays are empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the start times and end times arrays as empty arrays.
  Act: Invoke activitySelection with the start times and end times arrays.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation: 
  This test validates the functionâ€™s ability to handle empty input. The expected outcome is derived based on the assumption that if there are no activities, the function should not select any.
  
Scenario 4: Test when startTimes and endTimes arrays have different lengths.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNonMatchingLengths
  Description: This test is designed to check if the function can handle the scenario when the lengths of the startTimes and endTimes do not match. Here, we are assuming function needs to throw proper exception for this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the startTimes array and the endTimes array with different lengths.
  Act: Invoke activitySelection with the startTimes and endTimes arrays.
  Assert: Assert that the function throws an exception of the appropriate type.
Validation: 
  This scenario validates that the function can handle cases where startTimes and endTimes arrays have inconsistent lengths.
  
Scenario 5: Test with overlapping activities.

Details:   
  TestName: testWithOverlappingActivities
  Description: This test verifies whether the function correctly selects the activities when some of them overlap.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the startTimes and endTimes arrays with valid data where some activities overlap.
  Act: Invoke activitySelection with startTimes and endTimes arrays.
  Assert: Assert whether the returned list of indices matches the expected list considering the overlapping activities.
Validation: 
   This test validates the ability of the function to handle overlapping activities and select the compatible ones based on their end times.
