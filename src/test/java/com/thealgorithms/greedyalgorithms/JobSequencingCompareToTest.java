Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the `compareTo` method:

**Scenario 1: Compare Jobs with Different Profits**

Details:
  TestName: compareJobsWithDifferentProfits
  Description: This test verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly compares two jobs with different profits.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two `Job` objects, `job1` and `job2`, with different profit values (e.g., 10 and 20).
  Act: Invoke `job1.compareTo(job2)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is negative (i.e., `job1` has a lower profit than `job2`).

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly compares the profit values of two jobs. This test ensures that the method returns a negative value when the current job's profit is lower than the other job's profit.

**Scenario 2: Compare Jobs with Same Profit**

Details:
  TestName: compareJobsWithSameProfit
  Description: This test verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly compares two jobs with the same profit.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two `Job` objects, `job1` and `job2`, with the same profit value (e.g., 10).
  Act: Invoke `job1.compareTo(job2)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0 (i.e., the jobs have the same profit).

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly handles the case where two jobs have the same profit. This test ensures that the method returns 0 when the profits are equal.

**Scenario 3: Compare Job with Null Profit**

Details:
  TestName: compareJobWithNullProfit
  Description: This test verifies that the `compareTo` method throws a `NullPointerException` when comparing a job with a null profit.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `Job` object, `job1`, with a null profit value.
  Act: Invoke `job1.compareTo(new Job())`.
  Assert: Assert that a `NullPointerException` is thrown.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly handles the case where a job has a null profit. This test ensures that the method throws a `NullPointerException` in such cases.

**Scenario 4: Compare Jobs with Negative Profits**

Details:
  TestName: compareJobsWithNegativeProfits
  Description: This test verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly compares two jobs with negative profits.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two `Job` objects, `job1` and `job2`, with negative profit values (e.g., -10 and -20).
  Act: Invoke `job1.compareTo(job2)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is positive (i.e., `job1` has a higher profit than `job2`).

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly compares the profit values of two jobs with negative profits. This test ensures that the method returns a positive value when the current job's profit is higher than the other job's profit.

**Scenario 5: Compare Jobs with Zero Profit**

Details:
  TestName: compareJobsWithZeroProfit
  Description: This test verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly compares two jobs with zero profit.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create two `Job` objects, `job1` and `job2`, with zero profit values.
  Act: Invoke `job1.compareTo(job2)`.
  Assert: Assert that the result is 0 (i.e., the jobs have the same profit).

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `compareTo` method correctly handles the case where two jobs have zero profit. This test ensures that the method returns 0 when the profits are equal to zero.
